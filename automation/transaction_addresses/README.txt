addressFiller.py is a python script designed to populate addresses from acipayments inc

assumptions:
you're using a custom report generated by acipayments 
the data to be written is formatted as the results of a query to the access database
both files must be CSVs

How to generate the custom report:
Tab: General
	Transaction Type: All Transactions
Tab: Advance Filters
	Select Field: Transaction Types
	Select Operator: Is
	Select Value: Payments
Tab: Output Columns
	Original Confirmation #
	First name
	Last/Business Name
	Address Line 1
	Address Line 2
	City
	State
	Zip
	Country Code
	Base Payment Amount
	Consumer Fee
	Total Amount
	Routing/CC Auth
	Client Fee
	Partner Fee
	Terminal ID
	Application Label
	AID
	Entry Method
	CVM

Do NOT add/remove output columns, or change their ordering

Run it with the dates you're looking for in range (I do transaction time but the other one 
should work too)

The way this one is coded is kind of dumb
I couldn't use the labelling index at first because I didn't realize there were spaces
before the header names. Eventually I figured it out, but I was mostly done by that point
and it works so I'm not about to overhaul the whole code. If it really bothers you you're welcome
to try and fix it.

You will need to edit the "folder" variable if you're not Paul and not running on the desktop
You shouldn't need to touch anything else
